# AWS KMS

AWS Key Management Service (KMS) is a managed service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that makes it easy for you to create and manage cryptographic keys used to encrypt your data. KMS enables you to control access to your keys and provides integrated encryption capabilities for a wide range of AWS services and applications.

A master key, also called a Customer Master Key or CMK, is created and used to generate a data key. The data key is then used to encrypt a disk file. The encrypted data key is stored within the encrypted file. To decrypt the file, the data key is decrypted and then used to decrypt the rest of the file. This manner of using master and data keys is called envelope encryption.

## Key Concepts

### Keys

- A key in KMS is a cryptographic key used to encrypt and decrypt data.
- KMS supports two types of keys: customer master keys (CMKs) and data keys.
- CMKs are the primary keys used to encrypt and decrypt data. They can be either customer-managed or AWS-managed.
- Data keys are keys generated by KMS to encrypt data. They are used for encrypting large volumes of data and are transient in nature.

### Encryption

- Encryption is the process of converting plaintext data into ciphertext using cryptographic algorithms and keys.
- KMS provides encryption APIs that enable you to encrypt and decrypt data using CMKs or data keys.

### Key Policies and IAM Policies

- Key policies in KMS control access to CMKs and define who can use them to encrypt and decrypt data.
- IAM policies are used to control access to KMS operations and resources such as keys and aliases.

### Key Rotation

- Key rotation is the process of periodically replacing cryptographic keys with new ones to enhance security.
- KMS supports automatic key rotation for customer-managed CMKs, simplifying the management of encryption keys.

### Integration

- KMS seamlessly integrates with various AWS services such as Amazon S3, Amazon EBS, Amazon RDS, AWS Lambda, and more, enabling you to encrypt data at rest and in transit.
