# CloudWatch Logs Insights Query Explanation

### Fields

The `fields` command is used to select specific fields from log events to include in the output.

```plaintext
fields @timestamp, @message, @type, @logStream, @requestId, @duration, @billedDuration, @maxMemoryUsed, @memorySize, @ingestionTime
```

- `@timestamp`: The time at which the log event was ingested.
- `@message`: The log message content.
- `@type`: The type of the log event (e.g., `Lambda`, `API Gateway`).
- `@logStream`: The log stream name, which helps identify the source of the log event.
- `@requestId`: A unique identifier for the request, often useful for tracing individual requests.
- `@duration`: The duration of the request or execution in milliseconds.
- `@billedDuration`: The duration billed for the request or execution in milliseconds.
- `@maxMemoryUsed`: The maximum amount of memory used during the execution of the request.
- `@memorySize`: The allocated memory size for the execution environment.
- `@ingestionTime`: The time when the log event was ingested into CloudWatch Logs.

### Filter

The `filter` command is used to include only the log events that match a specified condition. The regular expression `/ (?i)(filter|fields|stats|sort|limit|pattern|parse|display|dedup|diff) /` is used to filter log messages that contain any of the specified keywords, ignoring case.

```plaintext
filter @message like /(?i)(filter|fields|stats|sort|limit|pattern|parse|display|dedup|diff)/
```

- `(?i)`: Case-insensitive matching.
- `filter|fields|stats|sort|limit|pattern|parse|display|dedup|diff`: Keywords to search for in the `@message` field.

### Stats

The `stats` command is used to calculate aggregate statistics for specified fields. The results are grouped by specified dimensions.

```plaintext
stats count(*) as count, avg(@duration), max(@maxMemoryUsed), min(@memorySize), sum(@billedDuration), stddev(@ingestionTime) by @type, @logStream, @requestId
```

- `count(*) as count`: Counts the total number of log events.
- `avg(@duration)`: Calculates the average duration of the requests.
- `max(@maxMemoryUsed)`: Finds the maximum memory used during the execution.
- `min(@memorySize)`: Finds the minimum memory size allocated.
- `sum(@billedDuration)`: Sums the billed durations.
- `stddev(@ingestionTime)`: Calculates the standard deviation of ingestion times.
- `by @type, @logStream, @requestId`: Groups the results by `@type`, `@logStream`, and `@requestId`.

### Sort

The `sort` command orders the results based on a specified field. In this case, it sorts the results by the `count` field in descending order.

```plaintext
sort count desc
```

- `count desc`: Sorts the results by the `count` field in descending order.

### Limit

The `limit` command restricts the number of results returned by the query. In this case, it limits the output to 1 result.

```plaintext
limit 1
```

- `1`: Limits the output to the top result based on the previous sorting.
